 Initial Analysis of the Dataset
Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains industry-wise financial data for a specific fiscal year (possibly 2023â€“2024).

It includes financial performance (Rs in crore) of various industries/sectors.

There are no missing values, and the data is clean and well-structured.

The data types include both categorical (text) and numerical values.

 Key Analysis:
Industry: Identifies the sector (e.g., Manufacturing, IT, Healthcare, etc.).

Rs in crore: Represents the revenue or financial value associated with each industry.

Other derived attributes like "Rs Last Year" and "Category" (High/Low) can be used for comparative and categorical analysis.

 Dataset Observations:
1. Financial Range & Data Quality:
The Rs in crore column shows a wide range of financial figures, indicating varying economic contributions from different industries.

Data has been thoroughly validated and shows no missing entries, ensuring robust analysis.

2. Revenue Distribution & Statistics:
Descriptive statistics reveal mean, median, and standard deviation of industry revenues.

Boxplots and histograms indicate the spread of revenue values, including outliers and dominant ranges.

3. Industry Contribution Analysis:
Certain industries contribute significantly more revenue than others.

Bar plots and pie charts clearly depict top-performing industries, while cumulative line plots show their proportional contribution.

4. Categorical Insights:
Industries are categorized into High/Low revenue groups based on the median.

Boxplots by category highlight the variation within each group.

Stacked histograms help understand the distribution of categories across revenue brackets.

5. Comparative & Trend Analysis:
A comparative line chart simulating "This Year vs Last Year" revenue reveals fluctuations or growth.

Area plots and cumulative trends visualize how revenue accumulates across industries.

Correlation analysis and heatmaps show relationships between revenue columns and derived financial indicators.

 Conclusion:
This dataset provides a strong foundation for understanding economic contributions across industry sectors. The visualizations and summary statistics help stakeholders:

Assess sectoral strengths,

Identify investment opportunities,

Detect outliers or underperforming industries, and

Support data-driven policymaking for economic planning and budget allocation.
